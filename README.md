================
Try `ruby script-1.rb` and check out the `output-secret.html`. You will see a neat weblog like website. Want to have your own blog posts? Just insert any text file into the `./posts` directory and re-run the script.

This is my first work in Ruby and it was fun. Thanks to http://tryruby.org/ for the inspiration.

See the wiki for more Ruby resources.
